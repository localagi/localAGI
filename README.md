### localAGI
Building AGI on local hardware.

Here because of https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT

Building contaners for effectively running a local artificial general intelligence.

## Motivation

Have reproducable software environments to spin up services on demand for testing, try out and - connecting to AGiXT.

## Sharing is caring

With strong expertise in `docker` and `github workflows` I want to bring all the AI-related projects online.

Working on [AI-dedicated Workflows](https://github.com/localagi/ai-dedicated-workflows) to share best practices over several repositories and projects.

## State of work

All the following projects are built using the above mentioned pipeline - my maintenance is focussed on build stabilty and availability of service containers.
