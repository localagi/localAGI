## ðŸ§® localAGI ðŸ§®
Fulltime nerd. Passionate developer. DevOp at heart.

Thats me. :bowtie: Building AGI on local hardware.

*You want to **run your own inferences** with ease? Good you are awake.*


Building contaners for effectively running a local artificial general intelligence. :mechanical_arm:

## :brain: Motivation :brain:

Initially started my work for deployments of [josh-XT/AGiXT](https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT)

Having reproducable software environments to spin up services on demand for testing and sky-netting.
Setup and streamline docker containers for quick and user friendly usage.

:rocket: CUDA enabled. :desktop_computer: BLAS enabled. :smirk: Conda-less. :onion: Matrix builds. :office: Multiarch builds. :child: :adult: :older_adult: For everyone.



## :hibiscus: Sharing is caring :hibiscus:

With strong expertise in `docker` and `github workflows` I want to test all the AI-related projects online using docker containers.

**Working on [AI-dedicated Workflows](https://github.com/localagi/ai-dedicated-workflows)** to share best practices over several repositories and projects.

### :star2: When you use any of my work, leave me a star! Thank you! :star2:

## State of work

The following projects on my namespace are built using the **[AI pipeline](https://github.com/localagi/ai-dedicated-workflows)**.
My maintenance is focussed on build stabilty and availability of service containers.

* :heavy_check_mark: == Working
* (:heavy_check_mark:) == Working soonish
* (WIP) == some unstable state
